This is an easy and system to record books you have read. By either selecting one of the three options, you can either leave a new review, view past reviews or exit the program. 
Upon writing the review you are asked to input the title, author, publication year, a rating out of 5 stars, and any additional comments you may have. 
You can leave comments empty but the publication year and rating must be number values.
